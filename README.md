# COMBINED_STRATEGY
COMBINE INSIDE BAR WITH SQUEEZE 

"Combine the trading logic from the 'SQUEEZE BREAKOUT' repository ([https://github.com/your-username/SQUEEZE-BREAKOUT](https://github.com/MaheshUmale/BREAKOUT_SCANNER_WEBAPP)) and the 'Inside Bar Breakout' repository ([https://github.com/your-username/Inside-Bar-Breakout](https://github.com/MaheshUmale/Inside-Bar-Breakout-Trading-Strategy-Multi-Bar)) into a single, cohesive trading strategy.

FOR SQUEEZE BREAKOUT REPO Main LOGIC is written in app.py and summerized in readme file

FOR Inside Bar Breakout Main logic is written in InsideBarBACKTEST.py and summerized in readme file

Here's what I want you to do:

1.  **Understand the Core Logic:**
    *   Review the `README.md` and the main strategy file (e.g., `squeeze_strategy.py` or `inside_bar_strategy.py`) in both repositories to understand the entry, exit, and indicator logic for each strategy.
    *   Pay close attention to how each strategy defines a "squeeze" and an "inside bar."

2.  **Create a New Strategy File:**
    *   Create a new Python file named `combined_strategy.py` in the target repository.

3.  **Integrate the Logic:**
    *   The new strategy should identify both a "squeeze breakout" condition AND an "inside bar breakout" condition.
    *   **Entry Condition:** The strategy should enter a trade ONLY if   inside bar breakout conditions happens inside  "squeeze" condition. ( Like 15 min INSIDE Bar beakout with RVOL>1.5 happen in SQUEEZE of HIGHER Tf 30 min SQZ)  OR
    *    (or within a specified proximity, if the original strategies allow). 
    We want to see an extra compression (i.e. Inside bar ) on lowertime frame and breakout , this Clearly define high probability entry signal.
    *   **Exit Condition:** Implement a combined exit strategy that incorporates elements from both original strategies. For example, if both strategies have independent stop-loss or take-profit rules, ensure the combined strategy considers the most conservative or effective rule.
    *   Also Use default trailing from inside bar strategy until "SQZ Breakout" in higher TF does not happen.
    *   If higher TF SQZ breakout happens TAKE PROFITE HALF on first close below low after  7 or 8th bar for long position. Similary for SHORT position , first close above high after 7th bar on TF where breakout happened.
    *   **Indicators:** Ensure all necessary indicators from both strategies are calculated and used correctly within the `combined_strategy.py` file. Reuse helper functions or indicator calculations where appropriate to avoid redundancy.

4.  **Refine and Optimize:**
    *   Ensure the code is well-structured, readable, and follows Python best practices.
    *   Add comments to explain the combined logic clearly.
    *   Consider adding parameters to the strategy that allow for fine-tuning the interaction between the squeeze and inside bar conditions (e.g., how close together they need to occur).

5.  **Provide Explanation:**
    *   Update the `README.md` in the target repository to explain the combined strategy's logic, including how the squeeze and inside bar conditions are used together, and any parameters that can be adjusted.
